# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game with two players X and O,who take turns and mark spaces in a 3*3 grid.The player who succeeds in placing three
of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row will be  the winner.Using HTML and CSS  I created a 3x3 grid user interface , 
where the players can mark their spaces.The dynamic part of the program is written using Javascript.
I have implemented a naive approach for deciding the winner ,i.e by taking the id of the input and verifying whether the combination makes 
a horizontal or vertical or diagonal triplet in javascript.
